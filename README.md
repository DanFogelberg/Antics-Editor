# Antics-Editor

A text editor demo created by [Simon LÃ¶vbacka](https://github.com/lovbackan) & [Dan Fogelberg](https://github.com/DanFogelberg) as part of our final project for our first year at YRGO studying web development. The conditions for the assignment is to implement typescript and that the time limit is two weeks!

## MVP

1. Give editor the power to create headings maybe h1 and h2 ?

2. Give editor the intelligence to save new lines, to seperate text parts!

## Decisions

1. Should this be a markdown language where we make something a heading by writing "#" or should we create an interface for the editor so that you select a textpart and press the heading button? Word vs Notion?

2. How should be save this to a database, how should we convert the data from the database into a heading?
